# üèóÔ∏è GanjaGuru Architecture Design Document

## Overview
GanjaGuru is a multi-layered, immersive cannabis metaverse integrating AI-driven budtender chatbots, AR/VR environments, 3DPoD design studios, and e-commerce capabilities.

## Core Components
- **Frontend:** Vue.js with Three.js for 3D, WebXR API for AR/VR, TailwindCSS for styling.
- **Backend:** Node.js/Express REST API, WebSocket real-time chat, MongoDB for user/strain data, Redis caching.
- **AI Services:** HuggingFace LLM API for NLP, local Whisper model for voice recognition.
- **Storage:** AWS S3 for assets, IPFS for decentralized 3DPoD files.
- **Deployment:** Netlify (frontend), DigitalOcean Kubernetes (backend), GitHub Actions for CI/CD.

## Data Flow
1. User interacts via floating islands or voice commands.
2. Requests processed in frontend; API calls backend services.
3. AI models invoked asynchronously; responses update UI.
4. 3DPoD exports uploaded and linked to user profile/storefront.
5. Transactions and gamification data recorded in MongoDB and Redis.

## Security Considerations
- OAuth2 + JWT for authentication.
- Encrypted storage for sensitive info.
- Rate limiting and input validation to prevent abuse.

## Scalability
- Microservices architecture supports independent scaling.
- CDN usage for static and 3D assets.
- Database sharding planned post-MVP.

## Extensibility
- Plugin SDK for external devs.
- Modular UI components and voice commands.
